# StepTracker üêæ
StepTracker is an application that tracks people steps in real time.
This is a project for subject ITCS424: Wireless and Mobile Computing with Lect. Snit Sanghlao as our advisor.
The purpose is to learn how to use Flutter, Dart and Android Studio, introduction in cloud storage using Firebase and utilization of the sensors present in our phone.
Our project will use both Firebase and a phone sensor in a form of a pedometer to create our application.

## Project Description
For our project, we decided to use the pedometer as our sensor, which allows us to count the number of steps the user of the phone takes.
This prompts us to not only learn the function of phone sensors but in cloud storage using firestore.
Not only that, we have decided to include the use of firebase for the storage of the history of our user‚Äôs daily stats as well.
Our objective of this project is to create an application that will help people in tandem to losing weight by encouraging people to walk more and be more consistent with their schedules.
- Develop the application to let people observe the steps count in real-time.
- Help people keep up with the amount of time and steps they have taken for the day.
- Keep track of users' activity history by storing the stats in Firebase.

Features:
- A fully functional real time step counter
- Sensor detection if you are walking or not
- A recording of the steps taken for the day
- A Firestore database that keeps track of your daily walk history
